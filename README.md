# Tidybase

## What's Tidybase?
(For now) Tidybase is a light wrapper around the Firebase JS/Web API.

## Why Tidybase?
It enables less overhead if ever switching the storage system.
That way apps don't need to be updated, but rather the internals
of this API wrapper.

Secondly Tidybase offers me more consistency of the API methods as 
opposed to the original API. 

Last but not least, having a wrapper allows for small adjustments 
and optimisations based on personal preference. Writing/using code 
that looks and feels like your own has it's merits (productivity,
less errors, etc.).
